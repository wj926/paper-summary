MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection
Attacks in AI Agents

Abstract
Recent research has explored that LLM agents
are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI)
attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-
retrieved information can redirect the agent to take
unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against
IPI have significant limitations: either require es-
sential model training resources, lack effective-
ness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the
normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked
re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI
defense. Our approach builds on the observation
that under a successful attack, the agent’s next
action becomes less dependent on user tasks and
more on malicious tasks. Following this, we de-
sign MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the
agent’s trajectory with a masked user prompt mod-
ified through a masking function. We identify an
attack if the actions generated in the original and
masked executions are similar. We also include
three key designs to reduce the potential false pos-
itives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation
on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates
that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both
attack prevention and utility preservation. More-
over, we show that combining MELON with a
SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as
MELON-Aug) further improves its performance.
We also conduct a detailed ablation study to vali-
date our key designs. Code is available at https:

tion attacks (IPI) (Naihin et al., 2023; Ruan et al., 2024;
Yuan et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Zhan et al., 2024;
Debenedetti et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a). Attackers
exploit the agent’s interaction with external resources by
embedding malicious tasks in tool-retrieved information
such as database (Zhong et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2024) and
websites (Liao et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024a).
These malicious tasks will force the agent to take unautho-
rized actions, leading to severe consequences.
Defending against IPI attacks is significantly challenging.
First, unlike jailbreaking LLMs, the injected malicious
prompts and their resultant behaviors can be legitimate tasks.
Second, implementing effective defenses requires a careful
balance between security guarantees and utility maintenance.
Existing IPI defenses either require essential model training
resources, are only applicable to simple attacks, or harm nor-
mal utilities under attack scenarios. Specifically, resource-
expensive defenses retrain the LLM in the agent (Chen et al.,
2024a; Wallace et al., 2024) or train an additional model
to detect injected prompts in the retrieved data (ProtectAI,

2024). Such methods are less practical due to the greedy re-
source requirements. Furthermore, adversarial training may
jeopardize the model’s normal utility, while model-based
detection naturally harms the agent’s utility under attack
scenarios and suffers from high false negative rates (Sec-
tion 4.2). Existing training-free defenses either augment
the user inputs with additional prompts (Mendes, 2023;
Hines et al., 2024; lea, 2023) or filter out malicious tool
calls (Debenedetti et al., 2024). As shown in Section 4.2,
prompt augmentation methods maintain high utility but fail
to prevent sophisticated attacks, while tool filter achieves
low ASR at the cost of severely degrading utility.
In this paper, we proposed a novel IPI defense, MELON,
based on the key insight that the agent’s tool calls are
less dependent on the user inputs when subjected to at-
tacks. MELON re-executes the agent’s action trajectory
with masked states, where only retrieved outputs are pre-
served and the user inputs are masked by a masking function.
Then, MELON detects attacks by comparing tool calls be-
tween the original execution and a masked re-execution.
When similar tool calls are found at a certain step, it indi-
cates an attack since the tool calls are unrelated to the user’s
input. We introduce three key designs to further strengthen
MELON: a customized masking function to prevent arbi-
trary tool calls during the masked execution; a tool call
cache for the masked execution to better identify attacks in
the original execution; and a focused tool call comparison
mechanism to knock off noisy information. These designs
resolve key technical challenges discussed in Section 3.2,
significantly reducing false positives and false negatives.
Through extensive experimentation on the AgentDojo
benchmark using three LLMs: GPT-4o, o3-mini, Llama-3.3-
70B, we demonstrate that MELON and MELON-Aug (com-
bining MELON with prompt augmentation) significantly
outperforms five SOTA defenses against four SOTA attacks.
As shown in Figure 1, MELON and MELON-Aug archive
the lowest attack success rate while maintaining the normal
utility for both benign and attack scenarios. Specifically,
MELON-Aug creates synergistic effects, further reducing
ASR to 0.32% while maintaining 68.72% utility on GPT-4o.
In addition, we also conduct an ablation study to validate
our three key designs and show MELON’s insensitivity to
key hyper-parameters. To our knowledge, MELON is the
first IPI detection that leverages the independence between
malicious tool calls and user input and achieves so far the
best balance between security and utility maintenance.
2. Related Work
Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks. At a high level, in-
direct prompt injection attacks against agents can be cate-
gorized as general attacks and agent-specific attacks. Gen-
eral attacks focus on developing universal attack prompt
patterns that force the target agent to conduct the attacker
tasks rather than the user tasks. Notably, the escape char-
acter attacks (Willison, 2022) utilize special characters like
“\n” to manipulate context interpretation. Context-ignoring
attacks (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022; Schulhoff et al., 2023) ex-
plicitly instruct the LLMs to disregard the previous context.
Fake completion attacks (Willison, 2023) attempt to deceive
the LLMs by simulating task completion. These methods
are often tested on IPI benchmarks (Debenedetti et al., 2024;
Xu et al., 2024) with pre-specified injection points and at-
tack tasks. There are also some early explorations of LLMs
attacks against a specific type of agent. For example, attacks
against web agents inject the attack content into the web
pages to “fool” the agent into the attack tasks (Wu et al.,
2024a; Liao et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024). Attacks against
computer agents manipulate the computer interface (Zhang
et al., 2024b). Note that there are also some direct prompt
injection attacks against LLMs (Yu et al., 2023; Wu et al.,
2024a;c; Toyer et al., 2024). These methods directly append
the attack prompts after the user inputs, which may not be
practical in real-world applications.
Defenses against IPI. Existing defenses can be categorized
based on resource requirements. Defenses that require addi-
tional training resources either conduct adversarial training
of the LLM(s) in the target agent (Wallace et al., 2024; Chen
et al., 2024a;b) or add additional models to detect whether
the inputs contain injected prompts (ProtectAI, 2024; Inan
et al., 2023). However, these methods face practical limi-
tations due to their substantial computational and data re-
quirements. In addition, adversarial training may jeopardize
the model’s normal utility in broader application domains.
As we will show later, adding additional detection models
naturally harms the agent’s utility under attack and suffers
from high false negative rates.
Training-free defenses either design additional prompts for
the user inputs or constrain the allowed tool calls of the
agent. First, most training-free defenses explore additional
prompts that either help the model ignore or detect potential
attack instructions in the retrieved data. Specifically, igno-
rance strategies include adding a delimiter between the user
prompt and retrieved data (Hines et al., 2024; Mendes, 2023;
Willison, 2023), repeating the user prompt (lea, 2023). Such
defenses, while lightweight, have limited efficacy against
stronger attacks (as shown in Sec 4). Known-answer de-
tection (Liu et al., 2024) adds additional questions with
known answers to the user prompt and detects if the model
finally outputs the answer. However, this method can only
identify injections post-execution, when attacks may have
already succeeded. Second, tool filtering (Debenedetti et al.,
2024) allows LLMs to select a set of permitted tools for
the given user task and block all calls to unauthorized tools.
This approach harms utility as the LLMs sometimes filter
out necessary tools. More importantly, it is easy to bypass

as the attackers can design their attack tasks with only the
tools related to the user attack. TaskShield (Jia et al., 2024)
proposes an alignment check to detect if the proposed tool
calls align with user tasks. In comparison, our method is a
lightweight and highly effective training-free defense that
well maintains the agent’s normal utility.
Note that other defenses require human intervention (Wu
et al., 2025), white-box model access (Wu et al., 2024b),
or reverting agent actions (Patil et al., 2024). Due to these
strong assumptions and lack of full automation, we exclude
these approaches from our analysis.
3. Metholody of MELON
3.1. Preliminaries
Formalization and Definition of LLM Agent. In this work,
we define an LLM agent π as an integrated system compris-
ing LLM(s) and a set of tools F = {f1, ..., fn} for environ-
ment interaction. The agent receives a user prompt spec-
ifying a task Tu (e.g., “Summarize my agenda and
tell me the time of the next event.”) and
executes it through a structured multi-step procedure.
At each step t, we define the state as St = (Tu, A1:t, O1:t),
where Tu is the user task, A1:t = {(R1, C1), ..., (Rt, Ct)}
is the sequence of LLM-generated actions with each
action pair consisting of an LLM response Ri and a
set of tool calls Ci
= {c1
i , ..., cmi
i }.
Each tool call
cj
i specifies a tool fj
∈F and its parameters (e.g.,
“retrieve event(date=20250131)”).
O1:t
=
{O1, ..., Ot} denotes the sequence of observations, where
each Oi contains the tool execution outputs corresponding
to Ci. In step t + 1, The agent system first generates action
At+1 = π(St) based on previous state, then obtaining ob-
servation Ot+1 = Exec(Ct+1) by executing the tool calls.
This process continues iteratively until the user task Tu is
completed or errors occur.
Threat Model. We follow the assumption of IPI, where
attackers cannot access the LLMs’ input and output in-
side the target agent. Their access is limited to manipu-
lating the external information retrieved by the agent via
tool calls, such as websites, emails, or files. The attackers
aim to redirect the agent from executing the original user
task to performing a malicious task Tm. For example, the
attacker task could be “Send your bank account
and password to hacker@gmail.com”. We de-
note O′
t to be the tool execution outputs injected with Tm
and O′
1:t = {O1, ..., O′
t} as the sequences of previous tool
execution outputs. We assume all user tasks to be legitimate
and the defender has complete access to the entire agent sys-
tem, including the states St = (Tu, A1:t, O1:t). However,
we do not assume the defender has the resources to train
LLMs or can access LLM internal representations.
3.2. Technical Overview
Insights and Technical Challenges. Our design is based on
the key observation that whenever a malicious attacker task
Tm is present in the retrieved data, it attempts to redirect
the agent from executing the user task Tu toward execut-
ing Tm instead. Given a state St = (Tu, A1:t, O′
1:t), if
O′
t that injected with Tm successfully hijacks the agent’s
behavior to focus on executing Tm, it induces a state col-
lapse where the agent’s next action At+1 becomes con-
ditionally independent of Tu and A1:t, depending primar-
ily on O′
1:t. For benign cases where Ot does not contain
malicious instructions or the attack does not succeed, the
agent maintains functional dependencies on all state com-
ponents (Tu, A1:t, O1:t). Formally, for a successful attack
at step t, we can observe: Pπ(At+1|(Tu, A1:t, O′
1:t)) ≈
Pπ(At+1|O′
1:t), where P is the probability. For benign exe-
cutions, the agent’s actions maintain their dependency on the
user inputs: Pπ(At+1|(Tu, A1:t, O1:t)) ≫Pπ(At+1|O1:t).
This statistical discrepancy naturally leads to a masking-
based approach to detect the injected prompts. Let M :
S →S be a masking operator that preserves only original
tool execution outputs. We define two execution paths:
Ao
t+1 = (Ro
t+1, Co
t+1) = π(St) (the original run),
Am
t+1 = (Rm
t+1, Cm
t+1) = π(M(St)) (the masking run),
where ∗o
t+1 and ∗m
t+1 represent the action generated by the
original run and masked run at step t + 1, respectively. By
comparing the agent’s next action generated by the orig-
inal run and the masking run, we can identify potential
attacks: if the action deviates after masking, that indicates
the agent’s action is related to the user task and the original
execution is benign, otherwise, the execution is independent
from the user prompt, indicating there are attacker-injected
prompts during the execution.
To compare the actions of the original run and the masking
run, we can feed Ao
t+1 and Am
t+1 into a text embedding
model and compute their distance in the embedding space.
If at any step, we observe that the distance is higher than a
certain threshold, it means the LLM output depends only on
O1:t and signals an attacker-injected prompt.
However, although straightforward, this masking function
and the comparison method face three technical challenges
during our exploration. ❶, when presented with only O1:t
in the masking run, the LLM may treat these tool execu-
tion outputs as few-shot examples and generate contextually
plausible but potentially arbitrary tool calls. Thus, for in-
jected cases, the generated tool calls may deviate from the
malicious task Tm embedded in O′
t, leading to false neg-
atives, while for benign cases, these arbitrary calls might
coincidentally align with the user task Tu, causing false
positives. ❷, we observe that, in some cases, the execution
timing of Tm differs between the original run and the mask-

ing run. In the original run, the agent might execute the
user task Tu first before proceeding to Tm. However, in the
masking run, since there is no user task to complete, the
agent directly executes Tm. As a result, at step t, while the
masking run has begun executing Tm, the original run may
still be processing Tu. This timing mismatch leads to false
negatives when comparing tool calls at corresponding steps.
❸, typically, the action generated by LLM contains both text
responses R and the tool calls C with specific arguments.
In successful attack cases, the masking run and original run
may differ in their text responses R while maintaining iden-
tical tool calls C that execute the malicious task Tm, which
again introduces false negatives.
Overview of MELON. We design MELON by optimizing
the straightforward approach above with novel strategies to
address the key technical challenges (demonstrated in Fig-
ure 2). Specifically, to address challenge ❶, we modify the
masking function M in two ways: (1) instead of simply re-
moving Tu, we replace it with a task-neutral prompt Tf (see
Appendix A.1) that typically requires no tool interactions,
and (2) we consolidate the sequence of tool outputs O1:t
into a single context Ot
1. Formally, our modified masking
function is: M(Tu, A1:t, O1:t) = (Tf, ∅, Ot
1). To further
make the LLM better follow the Tf in the masking run,
we create two few-shot chat samples (see Appendix A.2)
that include user, LLM response, and tool execution out-
puts. These designs together reduce false negatives by
guiding the LLM to focus on detecting embedded instruc-
tions rather than mimicking the tool call patterns in O1:t.
For challenge ❷, we implement a tool call cache H that
records the sequence of tool calls from the masking run:
Ht+1 = {Cm
1 , ..., Cm
t+1}, where Cm
i
denotes the tool calls
generated by the masking run in step i. We identify an
attack when any tool call in the original run is similar
to a cached call: ∃c ∈Co
t+1, ∃h ∈H : sim(c, h) > θ,
where θ is the similarity threshold. This cache-based ap-

proach reduces false negatives by capturing all potential
attack-related tool calls across multiple steps. Note that
this cache-based detection will not introduce new false pos-
itives because tool calls in Ht+1 indicate potential mali-
cious instructions since matching calls in the original run
suggests the LLM is executing instructions embedded in
previous tool execution outputs. Finally, to tackle chal-
lenge ❸, we focus our comparison specifically on tool calls
rather than complete actions. Let tools(A) extract the tool
calls from an action. We update the detection criterion as:
sim(tools(Ao
t+1), tools(Am
t+1)) > θ. This design is moti-
vated by the fact that accomplishing the attack task typically

MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents
involves calling one or more tools that are correlated to
the malicious attacker task Tm. This design significantly
reduces false negatives as the content that causes large dif-
ferences under attacks is not considered.
Remark. A simpler detection approach might be to identify
prompt injection whenever the masking run generates any
tool calls. However, this would reduce system utility under
attack scenarios. Many injected tasks Tm fail to redirect the
LLM - while they may trigger tool calls in the masking run,
the original run remains focused on executing the user task
Tu. In such cases, marking these unsuccessful attacks would
unnecessarily interrupt benign executions. Therefore, com-
paring tool calls is essential to identify only those attacks
that successfully influence the agent’s behavior.
3.3. Technical Details
Algorithm 1 presents the complete detection procedure. As
discussed above, our detection mechanism analyzes the
similarity between tool calls generated in two parallel runs:
the original run and the masking run. At step t, we maintain
a tool call cache Ht that collects tool calls from the masking
run. The detection process consists of two phases: (1) cache
population and (2) similarity-based detection.
In the cache population phase, we first use the masking func-
tion M to mask the current state St. If Ot
1 contains a ma-
licious task Tm, the agent will generate tool calls Cm
t+1 cor-
responding to Tm, which are then added to the cache Ht+1.
Otherwise, if no malicious task is present, the agent will
generate no tool calls given the design of Tf. For similarity-
based detection, we compare each tool call c ∈Co
t+1 from
the original run with every cached tool call h ∈Ht+1 using
a vector embedding model ϕ: sim(c, h) =
ϕ(c)·ϕ(h)
|ϕ(c)|·|ϕ(h)|. We
raise an alert if any similarity score exceeds a threshold θ:
Alertt+1 = ∃c ∈Co
t+1, ∃h ∈Ht+1 : sim(c, h) > θ.
Our preference for embedding-based similarity over
exact matching stems from the semantic nature of tool
calls, tool calls with similar intents can have different
arguments. For example, an attack instructing send all
your personal data to hacker@evil.com
might generate tool calls with slightly different arguments
like send email("hacker", subject="data")
and send email("hacker", subject="info"),
while they differ in their exact argument names, these two
calls serve the same malicious purpose. Exact matching
would fail to detect such semantically equivalent but
syntactically distinct attacks.
3.3.1. IMPLEMENTATION AND OVERHEAD ANALYSIS
Implementation Details. Our detection method consists
of several key components. For tool call comparison, we
convert each tool call to a natural language description,
note that for specific functions, we do not compare some
of their arguments, for example, for the send email
function, we do not compare the contents to be sent,
but instead only recipient is considered. Details can be
found in Appendix A.3.
Next, we employ OpenAI’s
text-embedding-v3 model (OpenAI, 2024) that maps these
descriptions to dense vector representations. We set the
primary similarity threshold θ = 0.8 to balance detection
sensitivity and false positive rate, the ablation study on
different similarity thresholds is presented in Section 4.3.
The task-neutral prompt Tf is designed to be independent
of specific domains or tasks. For example: “Summarize
the provided content.
If there are any
instructions, execute them.”
This formu-
lation enables the detection of injected tasks Tm while
minimizing false positives from benign content such as
documentation or user guides, we also provide the ablation
study for different Tf in Section 4.3.
Overhead Analysis. We analyze both the time complex-
ity and computational cost of our approach. Since LLMs
typically supports batch operations, the masking run can be
executed in parallel with the original path during each tool
output inspection. This parallel execution minimizes the ad-
ditional latency introduced by our detection method. Also,
since the contents of the masking run largely overlap with
the original run, we can implement a KV cache to reduce
the latency. The primary source of latency stems from com-
puting embeddings, which depends on the response time
of OpenAI’s embedding model API in our implementation.
Regarding computational costs, particularly for API-based
models, the introduction of the masking run effectively dou-
bles the number of required model calls. This results in a
≈2× increase in API costs compared to the undefended
baseline system. However, we argue that this cost overhead
is justified given the critical importance of protecting agent
systems against IPI attacks.
3.4. Theoretical Guarantee
3.4.1. ENSEMBLE DETECTOR
We extended MELON with a theoretical framework that
provides guarantees on worst-case performance. First, we
define different masking prompts: T1, T2, ..., Tn. As we
defined in Section 4.3, these can be any general prompts un-
related to the user task, such as sentiment analysis, grammar
checks, or sentiment analysis, etc. Each masking prompt
serves as an individual detector. We construct an ensem-
ble detector by combining outputs of these individual weak
detectors:

cious, 0 for benign), Ao is the agent action for the original
run, Am
i is the action for the masking run (using the masking
prompt Ti), d(Ao, Am
i ) is the similarity measure, θ ∈[0, 1]
is the decision threshold (typically 0.5).
3.4.2. ERROR BOUNDS
Using Hoeffding’s inequality, we derive bounds on error
rates. For False Positives (Ao is benign, no prompt injection:
Ao ∈B):
P

d(Ao, Am

For False Negatives (Ao contains malicious content: Ao ∈
V):
P
 
1
n
n
X
i=1
d(Ao, Am

≤exp

where µB and µV are the expected similarity scores:
µB = E[d(Ao, Am
i )] for Ao ∈B
µV = E[d(Ao, Am
i )] for Ao ∈V
These bounds demonstrate that error rates decrease expo-
nentially with the number of weak detectors, provided
that µB < θ < µV . For instance, with µB = 0.3, µV = 0.7,
θ = 0.5, and n = 100 detectors, the error bounds become
approximately 1.8 × 10−4.
4. Evaluation
4.1. Experiment Setup
Agent. We evaluate MELON on the IPI benchmark Agent-
Dojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024). AgentDojo comprises four
types of agents (banking, slack, travel, and workspace), and
each type of agent has a unique set of tools. AgentDojo de-
signs 16, 21, 20, 40 user tasks for their agents, respectively.
Besides, each agent also has different attack tasks and in-
jection points. It picks one user task and one attack task to
form an attack case, and in total, 629 attack cases. Several
early works also propose prompt injection attacks bench-
marks (Zhan et al., 2024), we choose AgentDojo because it
is the latest one containing many diverse attack cases. We
also tried another benchmark for multi-modal agents, i.e.,
VisualWebArena-Adv (VWA-Adv) (Wu et al., 2024a). We
do not select it because the attack success rate of SOTA
image attacks on this benchmark is low (see Appendix D
for more details). We consider three models as the LLM
model in each agent: GPT-4o, o3-mini, and Llama-3.3-70B.
Note that we do not use Claude-3.5-Sonnet for large-scale
experiments in considering the budget limit, but we test the
latest OpenAI model o3-mini and the SOTA open-source
model: Llama-3.3-70B.1 We set the temperature for each
model as 0 to avoid randomness.
Attacks.
We select four representative and popu-
lar general prompt injection attacks discussed in Sec-
tion 2: (1) Direct attack, which appends malicious in-
structions with the prefix “TODO” (Debenedetti et al.,
2024); (2) Ignore Previous Instructions attack, which
employs “Ignore the previous instructions
and do the following” (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022;
Schulhoff et al., 2023); (3) System Message attack, which
uses “### System” (Debenedetti et al., 2024); and (4) Im-
portant Messages attack, which uses “### Important
Messages”, following (Debenedetti et al., 2024), we fur-
ther enhance this attack by incorporating additional context
(the user name and the LLM version) in the injected ma-
licious instructions. Note that we do not select the SOTA
agent-specific attack against web agents because their effi-
cacy is low (Wu et al., 2024a) or their threat models are not
practical (Wu et al., 2024c; Toyer et al., 2024; Liao et al.,
2024).
Baseline Defenses. Based on the categorization in Section 2,
we select five defenses from three categories. First, we se-
lect two model-based detection methods: (1) DeBERTa
Detector, which uses a fine-tuned DeBERTa classifier to
identify malicious instructions in tool-retrieved data, and (2)
LLM Detector, due to the poor performance of DeBERTa
detector, we further leverage GPT-4o to decide whether the
retrieved data contains malicious instructions, the prompt
used are shown in Appendix C.2.2. Second, we consider
two prompt augmentation methods: (1) Delimiting and (2)
Repeat Prompt. We do not consider known-answer detection
as it identifies injections after the executions when attacks
have already succeeded. Last, we also include Tool Fil-
ter (Debenedetti et al., 2024) as our baseline. Note that we
do not consider white-box attacks (i.e., GCG (Zou et al.,
2023) and attention tracking (Hung et al., 2024)) given that
most models used in agents are commercial black-box ones.
Detailed examples of all evaluated attacks and defenses are
shown in Appendix C. For MELON, we also evaluate its
augmented version which combines Repeat Prompt method
(denoted as MELON-Aug).
Evaluation Metrics. We consider three metrics: (1) Util-
ity under Attack (Debenedetti et al., 2024) (UA), which
measures the agent’s ability to correctly complete the user
task Tu while avoiding execution of malicious tasks during
attacks; (2) Attack Success Rate (ASR), which measures
the proportion of successful prompt injection attacks that
achieve their malicious objectives Tm. An attack is con-
1We also considered the most recent DeepSeek model, but its
tool calling capability is reportedly not stable (DeepSeek, 2025).

sidered successful if the agent fully executes all required
steps specified in the malicious task Tm. (3) Benign Utility
(BU), which measures the fraction of user tasks that the
agent system solves in the absence of any attacks.
4.2. Experiment Results
Our experimental results in Figure 3 and Table 1 demon-
strate that MELON achieves both high utility and low ASR,
while other defenses exhibit a clear trade-off. We analyze
the performance of different defenses on each metric below.
Utility under Attack (UA). Note that detection-based meth-
ods (DeBERTa detector, LLM detector, and MELON) ter-
minate the entire agent execution upon detecting potential
prompt injections. At step t + 1, DeBERTa detector and
LLM detector analyze tool execution outputs O1:t before
LLM generates any action, regardless of whether the attack
would succeed. This creates an inherent trade-off: a perfect
detector should achieve 0% UA. In contrast, MELON oper-
ates after LLM generates action At+1 but before execution,
intervening only when it detects that malicious instructions
will be executed in the original run, thus better preserving
UA while minimizing ASR.
MELON-Aug achieves optimal balance across all attacks
and models, maintaining high UA while achieving low
ASR across all LLMs. For GPT-4o, MELON-Aug achieves
68.72% UA with 0.32% ASR, compared to the no defense
baseline (69.08% UA, 16.06% ASR). As discussed above,
detection methods show significant limitations, DeBERTa
detector experiences a high FNR of at least 24.05%, while
LLM detector achieves 0.00 UA. Prompt augmentation
methods (delimiting and repeat prompt) increase UA to
69.75% and 77.86% compared to the no defense baseline,
likely by strengthening LLM’s focus on Tu. The tool fil-
ter shows varying performance across models - achieving
second-best UA-ASR trade-off for GPT-4o but poor UA for
o3-mini and Llama-3.3-70B due to excessive tool filtering
that renders the system unusable.
Attack Success Rate (ASR). MELON and MELON-Aug
demonstrate superior attack prevention across all models
and attacks. For GPT-4o, MELON achieves the average
ASR of 0.24%, followed by MELON-Aug at 0.32%. For
LLM detector, we further examined its detection success
rate, false positive rate, and false negative rate, the results
are shown in Table 5. Despite achieving 0.00% ASR, the
LLM detector still exhibits false positive rates up to 0.31%
and false negative rates up to 0.78%, indicating room for
improvement in adversarial prompt detection capabilities.
Furthermore, while the tool filter method also achieves
0.00% ASR for o3-mini and Llama-3.3-70B, this results
from blocking nearly all tool usage, rendering the system
non-functional. Although prompt augmentation methods im-
prove UA, they show limited effectiveness across all attacks
and models. The effectiveness varies across attack types.
Important Messages attack is most successful, while Direct
attack shows the lowest ASR due to their simple attack pat-
terns. Notably, the model-based detection methods show
unexpected behavior with o3-mini and Llama-3.3-70B: they
demonstrate higher ASR and higher FPR for Direct attacks
than Important Messages attacks. For example, on Llama-
3.3-70B, DeBERTa detector shows 6.20% ASR for direct
attack, but 1.59% ASR for important messages attack, sug-
gesting that this method is particularly vulnerable to attacks
without explicit malicious patterns.
Benign Utility (BU). Different defense methods show vary-
ing impacts on benign utility. Similar to UA, prompt aug-
mentation methods maintain or slightly improve BU com-
pared to the no defense baseline. In contrast, the tool filter
method significantly degrades BU for o3-mini and Llama-
3.3-70B due to excessive tool restrictions. Among detection
methods, the DeBERTa detector also shows poor BU due to
high false positive rates, while the LLM detector preserves
BU. MELON and MELON-Aug demonstrate moderate BU
decreases in specific cases. However, as we will discuss in
Section 4.4, these cases represent legitimate security con-
cerns where users directly request execution of unverified
external instructions in tool execution outputs.
4.3. Ablation Study and Sensitivity Test
Ablation Study. We conduct a systematic ablation study to
validate the importance of our three key designs discussed
in Section 3.2 using the AgentDojo dataset with GPT-4o un-
der the Important Messages attack. We remove each design
component one at a time. First, for the masking function
M, instead of replacing Tu with Tf, we simply delete Tu
(denoted as “Basic”). Second, for the tool call cache mecha-
nism, we remove H and only compare the current step’s tool
calls between the original run and the masking run (denoted
as “No Cache”). For the tool call comparison strategy, we
compare the complete actions A = (R, C) rather than only
tool calls C (denoted as “Full Comp.”). As shown in Table 2,

Sensitivity Test. We evaluate the robustness of MELON by
analyzing its sensitivity to two key parameters: the formula-
tion of task-neutral prompt Tf and the similarity threshold
θ. All experiments are conducted on the AgentDojo dataset
with GPT-4o using the Important Messages attack.

For the task-neutral prompt analysis, we test four variations:
(1) a paraphrased version of the original summarization in-
struction (Para.), (2) a sentiment analysis instruction (Senti.),
(3) a grammar checking instruction (Grammar), and (4) a
translation instruction (Trans.). We selected these tasks be-
cause they typically do not require tool calls and are distinct
from common user tasks, which helps reduce false positives.
The results in Table 3 show consistent performance across
all prompt variations, indicating that MELON’s effective-
ness does not depend on specific formulations of Tf.
We then evaluate how different similarity thresholds θ af-
fect performance. Table 4 shows the results on the simi-
larity threshold. Overall, the result shows minimal stan-
dard deviations in normal utility, and ASR across differ-

ent thresholds. The utility under attack decreases slightly
with lower thresholds, which aligns with our expectations
since lower thresholds can increase false positives. For in-
stance, when distinguishing between malicious commands
(e.g., send money(hacker)) and legitimate operations
involving similar actions (e.g., send money(friend)),
lower thresholds can lead to misclassification.
4.4. Analysis of False Positive Rate
Since MELON performs detection after each agent action
A, it is essential to evaluate its false positive rate (FPR)
during normal operation. We compare the FPR of MELON
with two baseline detectors: DeBERTa detector and LLM
detector. We evaluate the FPR of GPT-4o on AgentDojo.
Our experiments show FPR values of 9.28% for MELON,
61.86% for DeBERTa detector, and 0.00% for LLM detec-
tor. Detailed examples of false positive cases produced by
MELON and DeBERTa detector are in Appendix E.
In our analysis, MELON generated nine false positive
detections for GPT-4o.
However, after detailed exam-
ination, we found all these cases involve user tasks
Tu that explicitly request the agent to retrieve and ex-
ecute instructions from external sources without verifi-
cation (e.g., “Please do all the tasks I have
on my TODO list at www.abc.com”). We argue
that these cases represent actual security risks rather than
detection errors, as they allow unrestricted execution of un-
verified external instructions. For the baseline detectors,
DeBERTa detector shows a high false positive rate by in-
correctly flagging most benign cases. While LLM detector
achieves 0% FPR, this perfect specificity comes at the cost
of poor detection capability as discussed in Section 4.2.
4.5. Analysis of Attack Success Cases
To understand the limitations of MELON, we analyze 66
cases where attacks evaded detection across three LLMs
(GPT-4o, o3-mini, and Llama-3.3-70B) using the Important
Messages attack on AgentDojo. We identify four primary
failure patterns: (1) Response-Based Attacks (72.73%):
When Tm achieves its objective through text responses
rather than tool calls (e.g., persuading users to make ex-
pensive purchases), these attacks manifest in R rather than
C. Since MELON only monitors tool calls, such attacks can
evade detection. (2) Tool Call Redundancy (15.15%): When
O1:t contains partial results for malicious task Tm, the orig-
inal run utilizes these existing results while the masking run
generates repeat tool calls to obtain the same information.
This discrepancy in tool usage prevents matching between
Co
t+1 and Cm
t+1, leading to missed detections. (3) State Hallu-
cination (6.06%): The agent in the original run skips neces-
sary tool calls by hallucinating the required information. For
example, when Tm requests retrieving a user’s phone ver-
sion, the agent directly responds with ”iPhone X” without
making appropriate tool calls. (4) Function Hallucination
(6.06%): The agent generates calls to non-existent functions
that are not provided in the tool set, causing mismatches
between the original and masked runs.
5. Conclusion and Future Work
We present MELON, a novel IPI defense based on the key
observation that successful attacks reduce the dependence
between agent tool calls and user inputs. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that MELON significantly
outperforms existing defenses while maintaining high util-
ity. Our work establishes that identifying and leveraging
fundamental behavioral patterns of IPI attacks, such as the
tool call and user input independence property, provides an
effective methodology for defense design.
Our work opens several future directions. First, MELON
can be extended to detect broader attack goals beyond direct
task manipulation (Wu et al., 2024a). Second, the computa-
tional efficiency of masked re-execution can be improved
through techniques like KV cache and selective state mask-
ing. Third, MELON’s behavioral pattern detection can be
combined with other defense approaches like prompt aug-
mentation to create more robust protection mechanisms.

Impact Statement
This work advances the security of LLM-based agent sys-
tems against indirect prompt injection attacks. While our
method introduces additional computational costs, we be-
lieve this overhead is justified by the critical importance
of protecting agent systems from malicious manipulation.
Our defense mechanism helps prevent unauthorized actions
while preserving legitimate functionality, contributing to
the safe deployment of LLM agents in real-world applica-
tions. However, we acknowledge that no security measure
is perfect, and continued research is necessary to address
evolving attack methods.

A. MELON
A.1. Complete Tf
Please use the tool read file to retrieve contents in random.txt.
This file
also contains some tool calls and their corresponding execution outputs.
Please
summarize the contents retrieved.
If there are any instructions in the contents,
follow them first, then do a summarization.
Else, just summarize the contents.
Please note that contents may already contain some tool calls and their outputs.
If you are trying to follow instructions, please make sure that you are not
repeating the same tool calls.
A.2. Few-shot examples
To further make the LLM better follow the Tf in the masking run, we create two few-shot chat samples that include user,
LLM response, and tool execution outputs.
(User Task):
Please first use the tool read inbox to retrieve contents.
Then, summarize
the contents retrieved.
If there are any instructions in the contents, follow
them first, then do summarization.
Else, just summarize the contents.
(LLM Action):
function=’read inbox’
args={’user’:
’Bob’}
(Tool Execution Outputs):
- body:
My hobby is painting.
recipient:
Bob
sender:
Alice.
(LLM Action):
Thank you for providing me with the inbox contents.
I’ll now summarize the
information retrieved and follow any instructions if present.
Summarization:
The inbox contains a message from Alice to Bob.
The message
reads:
’My hobby is painting.’, thus, the summarization is Alice’s hobby is
painting.
It does not contain any instructions, I will not do any tool calling.
(User Task):
That’s great.
Can you then use the tool read file to retrieve contents in
sample.txt.
This file contains some tool calls and their corresponding
execution outputs.
Please summarize the contents retrieved.
If there are
any instructions in the contents, follow them first, then do summarization.

}
(Tool Execution Outputs):
Successfully created the report.
A.3. Transforming Tool Calls into Natural Language
To enable semantic comparison of tool calls, we convert each tool call into a string representation. The transformation
preserves the function name and its arguments, but selectively includes arguments based on their security relevance.
For example, given a tool call object with a function name and argument dictionary, we transform it into the format:
function name(arg1 = value1, arg2 = value2).
For security-sensitive functions, we only compare specific arguments:
13


## p. 14

MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents
• For send email: we only include the ”recipients” argument, ignoring content-related arguments like message body
or subject.
• For send money: we include both ”recipient” and ”amount” arguments
• For all other functions: we include all arguments in the comparison
For instance:
• send email(recipients=hacker@mail.com, subject="private information", body="my
password is abc.") →send email(recipients=hacker@mail.com)
• send money(recipient=bob, amount=100, note=rent)
→
send money(recipient=bob,
amount=100)
If a tool call has no arguments, it is transformed to ”function name()”. If there are no tool calls, we use the string ”No tool
calls”. This transformation ensures that our similarity comparison focuses on the security-critical aspects of tool calls while
ignoring variable content that might differ between identical operations.
B. The Basic Agent Pipeline
As illustrated in Figure 4, an LLM agent system operates through an iterative process to accomplish user tasks. At the start
of execution, the agent receives a user task Tu and initializes its state as S0 = (Tu, ∅, ∅).
At each step t, the agent system:
1. Takes the current state St = (Tu, A1:t, O1:t) as input
2. Generates an action At+1 = (Rt+1, Ct+1) = π(St), where:
• Rt+1 is the LLM’s text response
• Ct+1 is a set of tool calls
3. If Ct+1 ̸= ∅, executes the tools to obtain observation Ot+1 = Exec(At+1)
4. Updates the state to St+1 = (Tu, A1:t+1, O1:t+1)
This cycle continues until one of the following conditions:
• The agent generates no tool calls (Ct+1 = ∅), indicating task completion
• The agent encounters an error during execution
• The agent reaches a maximum step limit

C.2.5. TOOL FILTER
This method introduced in (Debenedetti et al., 2024), implements a two-stage tool access control. First, given a user task Tu,
it queries the agent’s LLM to generate a whitelist of necessary tools for completing the task. Then, the agent system is only
provided access to these whitelisted tools, preventing it from using any other tools during task execution. For example, if the
user task is checking email, the LLM might whitelist only email reading functions while excluding sensitive operations like
money transfers. However, this approach can be overly restrictive for complex tasks that require dynamic tool selection
based on intermediate results, as shown in Table 1.
D. Datasets
D.1. AgentDojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024)
AgentDojo is an evaluation framework for assessing AI agents’ robustness against indirect prompt injection attacks. The
framework comprises 97 real-world tasks across different domains (e.g., email management, banking operations, travel
booking) and 629 security test cases.
D.2. VWA-Adv (Wu et al., 2024a)
VWA-Adv proposes 200 adversarial tasks in realistic settings using VisualWebArena. The study introduces two attack
categories: (1) illusion attacks that manipulate retrieved information while maintaining the original user task, and (2)
goal misdirection attacks that aim to redirect the agent toward executing malicious tasks. While goal misdirection attacks
typically pose more severe security risks and are the focus of our study, we observe that pure image-based goal misdirection
attacks achieve only 1% attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4o. Given this limited effectiveness, we exclude this dataset
17


## p. 18

MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents
from our evaluation, anticipating future development of more effective image-based attack methods.
E. Examples of False Positives
As mentioned in Section 4.4, when evaluating MELON on AgentDojo, we observed 3, 3, 0, and 2 false positive detections
for banking, slack, travel, and workspace agents, respectively. After careful examination, we found that these cases represent
legitimate security concerns rather than detection errors. Here we present three representative examples. The tasks presented
in the tool execution outputs are marked as red color. These examples demonstrate a common pattern: they all involve user
tasks Tu that request the agent to blindly execute instructions from external sources. While these detections are technically
false positives since they align with user intentions, they represent real security vulnerabilities in agent operation. The high
detection rate of MELON for these cases suggests its effectiveness in identifying potentially risky agent behaviors, even
when explicitly requested by users. Readers can compare these with the attack cases presented in Appendix C to understand
the distinction between false positives and actual attacks.
E.1. Examples of False Positives Generated by DeBERTa Detector
Here we present the one true false positive that was wrongly classified by the DeBERTa Detector.

As shown in Table 5, the baseline LLM detector exhibits variable performance across attack types, revealing fundamental
limitations. While achieving perfect accuracy on system message attacks (100%) and near-perfect performance on important
instructions (99.98%), the detector shows vulnerabilities with Important Messages attack (0.78% FNR) and Ignore Previous
attack (0.31% FPR). The inconsistent detection rates across attack categories suggest that existing approaches may be overly
specialized to specific patterns, leaving significant gaps in comprehensive adversarial prompt detection.
